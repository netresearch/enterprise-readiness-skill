# Enterprise Readiness Skill

A [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) skill for assessing and enhancing software projects to meet enterprise-grade standards for security, quality, and automation.

## Overview

This skill provides a comprehensive framework with:
- **Complete OpenSSF Badge Coverage** - Passing, Silver, and Gold level criteria
- **Dynamic Scoring System** - Fair assessment across different tech stacks
- **120+ Security & Quality Checks** - Covering supply chain, testing, governance, and automation
- **Implementation Patterns** - Ready-to-use code for SLSA, Cosign, GitHub hardening
- **Extensible Architecture** - General → Platform → Language → Badge Level modular design

## OpenSSF Framework Alignment

| Framework | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| OpenSSF Scorecard | 18/20 checks (~90%) |
| Best Practices Badge - Passing | 68/68 criteria (100%) |
| Best Practices Badge - Silver | 55 criteria documented |
| Best Practices Badge - Gold | 24 criteria documented |
| SLSA Framework | Full L1-L3 |
| S2C2F | 6/8 practices (~75%) |

## Installation

### Option 1: Direct Installation

```bash
# Clone to your Claude skills directory
git clone https://github.com/netresearch/enterprise-readiness-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/enterprise-readiness
```

### Option 2: Download ZIP

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/netresearch/enterprise-readiness-skill/releases) and extract to `~/.claude/skills/enterprise-readiness/`.

## Usage

The skill triggers automatically on keywords like:
- "enterprise ready"
- "production ready"
- "security hardening"
- "supply chain security"
- "SLSA"
- "OpenSSF Scorecard"
- "silver badge" / "gold badge"

### Example Prompts

```
"Assess this project for enterprise readiness"
"How can I make this repository production ready?"
"Implement SLSA Level 3 provenance for this project"
"Harden the GitHub Actions workflows"
"What do I need for OpenSSF Silver badge?"
"Help me achieve Gold level certification"
```

## Assessment Categories

### Core Assessment (120 points)

| Category | Points | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Governance & Policy | 10 | Security policy, licensing, maintenance, SLAs |
| Supply Chain Security | 15 | Provenance, signing, SBOMs, checksums |
| Dependency Consumption | 10 | Vulnerability scanning, license compliance |
| Quality Gates | 10 | Coverage thresholds, static analysis |
| Testing Layers | 10 | Unit, integration, fuzz, E2E tests |
| Documentation | 5 | README, CONTRIBUTING, API docs |
| **Total General** | **60** | Universal checks for any platform/language |
| GitHub Hardening | 40 | Harden runner, pinned actions, permissions |
| Go Best Practices | 20 | Static builds, golangci-lint, govulncheck |

### Badge Level Criteria

| Level | Criteria | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Passing | 68 | Technical basics, security policy |
| Silver | +55 | Governance, documentation, 80% coverage |
| Gold | +24 | Organizational maturity, 90% coverage, audits |

## Scoring

Uses **Dynamic Denominator** scoring for fairness:

```
Score = (Points_Earned / Max_Points_Applicable) × 100
```

| Score | Grade | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 90-100 | A | Enterprise Ready |
| 80-89 | B | Production Ready (minor gaps) |
| 70-79 | C | Development Ready (needs hardening) |
| 60-69 | D | Basic (significant gaps) |
| Below 60 | F | Not Ready (major improvements needed) |

## Extensibility

The skill is designed for extension. Additional modules can be added:

**Platform Modules (planned):**
- `references/gitlab.md`
- `references/bitbucket.md`
- `references/azure-devops.md`

**Language Modules (planned):**
- `references/python.md`
- `references/typescript.md`
- `references/rust.md`
- `references/java.md`

## Key Implementation Patterns

### SLSA Level 3 Provenance

```yaml
uses: slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/builder_go_slsa3.yml@v2.1.0
with:
  go-version-file: go.mod
  config-file: .slsa-goreleaser/${{ matrix.target }}.yml
  evaluated-envs: "VERSION:${{ github.ref_name }}, COMMIT:${{ github.sha }}"
```

### Keyless Signing with Cosign

```yaml
- uses: sigstore/cosign-installer@v3.8.2
- run: cosign sign-blob --yes --output-certificate file.pem --output-signature file.sig file.txt
```

### Workflow Hardening

```yaml
permissions: read-all

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - uses: step-security/harden-runner@SHA
        with:
          egress-policy: audit
      - uses: actions/checkout@SHA  # Pin to SHA, not tag
```

### Badge Level Quick Reference

**Passing:** SECURITY.md, LICENSE, CI/CD, static analysis
**Silver:** DCO, GOVERNANCE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, 80% coverage, signed releases
**Gold:** 90% coverage, 2-person review, security audit, reproducible builds

---

**Version 3.4.0** - Added signed tag verification, PR review requirements check, and TLS 1.2+ enforcement scripts for complete Silver/Gold badge criteria coverage. Previous: v3.3.0 added bus factor analysis, SPDX verification, reproducible builds, branch coverage scripts; security audit and badge exceptions templates; solo maintainer, dynamic analysis, and branch coverage guides. Fixed shell script portability.
