# CodeQL Security Analysis
# https://codeql.github.com/
#
# MANDATORY: Use this custom workflow instead of GitHub's Default Setup.
# Default Setup is ClickOps - not auditable, not templatable, causes drift.
#
# Before adding this file, disable Default Setup if enabled:
#   gh api -X PATCH repos/OWNER/REPO/code-scanning/default-setup -f state="not-configured"
#
# Languages to scan:
# - actions: ALWAYS include (scans workflow files for security issues)
# - javascript: Include if repo has .js/.ts/.jsx/.tsx files
# - python, java, go, ruby, csharp, cpp, swift: Include if applicable
# - php: NOT SUPPORTED by CodeQL (use PHPStan/Psalm/Semgrep instead)
